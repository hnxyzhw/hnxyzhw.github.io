	•	3. 1.1 BUSINESS: PAYMENTS - IN-APP PURCHASE 
Business - 3.1.1


We noticed that your app enables the purchase of content, services, or functionality in the app by means other than the In-App Purchase API, which is not allowed on the App Store. 

Next Steps

While the payment system that you have included may conduct the transaction outside of the app, if the purchasable content, functionality, or services are intended to be used in the app, they must be purchased through IAP, within the app - unless it is of the type referenced in Guideline 3.1.3.

In-App Purchase

It may be appropriate to revise your app to use the In-App Purchase API to provide content purchasing functionality.

In-App Purchase provides several benefits, including:
- The flexibility to support a variety of business models.
- Impacting your app ranking by consolidating your sales to one app rather than distributing them across multiple apps.
- An effective marketing vehicle to drive additional sales of new content.

For information on In-App Purchase, please refer to the following documentation:

[In-App Purchase Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/StoreKitGuide/Introduction.html)

For step-by-step instructions on In-App Purchase creation within iTunes Connect, refer to [In-App Purchase for Developers](https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/).

个人理解：
对用应用内有虚拟货币交易类型的app，是必须要走苹果内购进行充值，支付的。不然的话是不给审核通过的。（提醒：对于那些想通过后台开关控制交易充值的显示的，如果被审查到会被下架，严重的可能账号都被封掉）
