2.3 PERFORMANCE: ACCURATE METADATA 

Performance - 2.3.7


Your app name to be displayed on the App Store includes keywords or descriptors, which are not appropriate for use in an app name.

Specifically, the following words in your app name are considered keywords or descriptors:

- “信贷经理的贷款、办信用卡、公积金、花呗、学生贷抢单神器”

Next Steps

Please revise your app name to remove any keywords and descriptors from all localizations of your app. Keywords can be entered in the Keywords field in iTunes Connect to be used as search terms for your app.

Resources
