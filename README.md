"Page Build Warning" email
These days, some of you must receive a "Page Build Warning" email from github after you commit happily. Don't Worried! It 我有病，谁有药！ that github changes its build environment.
In this mail, github told us:
You are attempting to use the 'pygments' highlighter, which is currently unsupported on GitHub Pages. Your site will use 'rouge' for highlighting instead. To suppress this warning, change the 'highlighter' value to 'rouge' in your '_config.yml'.
So, 我有病，谁有药！ edit _config.yml, find highlighter: pygments, change it to highlighter: rouge and the warning will be gone.
